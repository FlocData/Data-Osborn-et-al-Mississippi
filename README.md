# Data-Osborn-et-al-Mississippi

This repository holds data associated with the paper by Osborn et al. on *The flocculation state of mud in the lowermost freshwater reaches of the Mississippi River: spatial distribution of sizes, seasonal changes, and their impact on vertical concentration profiles* currently in review at JGR Earth Surface.

The data is grouped into the following three folders:
1. *0 Raw particle sizes:* contains the individual particle size measurements and associated depths. All values are given in pixels and no filtering of out-of-focus particles has taken place.
2. *1 Size stats over depth:* Floc size distribution statistics D16, D50, and D84 over the depth. Sizes are in microns.
3. *2 Image concentration profiles:* Corrected concentration data from the camera images.

All figures can be reproduced with the data in *0 Raw particle sizes*. Figures 4 and 7 are more readily available through folders *1 Size stats over depth* and *2 Image concentration profiles* respectively.
