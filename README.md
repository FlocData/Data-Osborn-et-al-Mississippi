# Data-Osborn-et-al-Mississippi

An initialized repository for the the data associated with the paper by Osborn et al. on *The flocculation state of mud in the lowermost freshwater reaches of the Mississippi River: spatial distribution of sizes, seasonal changes, and their impact on vertical concentration profiles* currently in review at JGR Earth Surface. The respository will be populated if the work is published.
